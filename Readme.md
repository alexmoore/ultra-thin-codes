An AutoHotKey Script to make the Apple Wired Keyboard work with Windows.

Most keys work out of the box when you plug in your Apple wired keyboard to a Windows PC, but some don't.
F10 does not work out of the box, which is one of the keys I use for debugging in Visual Studio / Chrome / etc.
Apple decided to use some crazy keycodes for some of the keys, so remappers like SharpKeys don't even pick up f10 keypresses.

This script was originally by "nathris" on overclock.net (http://www.overclock.net/t/1231886/guide-using-the-apple-wired-keyboard-in-windows-7), this version is just min'd down to one file and customized for myself.
